# About Me
I'm a fresh sustainability graduate from Heriot Watt university, but my love and passion for data analysis still remained intact throughout my academic journey. I have worked in different companies in Pakistan, and I am looking for more opportunities to expand my horizons for data analysis, learning new skills and methods to grow as an individual, and also as a data analyst.
